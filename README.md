# BridgeFi

> **Closing the Loop Between Applicant Effort & Recruiter Response**

A dual-sided intelligence platform for skill-gap bridging, ghosting prevention & personal career analytics.

**"Not another resume parser. Not another tracker. Two sides. One solution."**

## Quick Start (No npm, No React, No errors!)

### Prerequisites

- pip

### 1. Clone & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bridgefi.git
cd bridgefi

## 🧠 AI Features

The Skill-Gap Analyzer uses **Claude claude-sonnet-4-20250514** to:
- Extract all required skills from a JD
- Prioritize them (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
- Uncover 5+ hidden signals not written in the JD
- Generate a concrete runnable mini-project to bridge gaps
- Calculate a match score

**Without an API key:** The app uses intelligent mock analysis that still demonstrates all features.

## Ghosting Prediction Algorithm

Factors used:
- **Department base rate** (Engineering 30%, HR 55%, etc.)
- **Days since applied** (sigmoid function peaking at ~14 days)
- **Company type** (FAANG companies respond 25% more)
- **Best day to apply**: Tuesday = ~2× response rate
